There are two scripts here:

scripts

script_drift

all folders are empty for the main run, so if somebody has GPU and wants to run whole training, use the docker file and all mlruns and best models will be saved in their folders. 

For sample, I tested this with 2 epoch and on a small dataset and saved all results. You can see that in Training_Deployment_Sample_Run folder.
